# Password_Generator
Password Generator App
I developed a Python-based password generator app called KeyKeeper. The app allows users to create strong, customizable passwords by selecting the desired length and choosing whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It ensures that the generated passwords are secure and random. I also added a feature to copy the password to the clipboard and optionally save it for future use. This project helped me understand Python basics like randomization, user input handling, and GUI design using libraries like tkinter
